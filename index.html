		<p> <a href="http://www.australia.com/en-us/places/vic/vic-12-apostles.html">australia.com</a> has a page on The Twelve Apostles. Their site looks very fancy (made with javascript), but unfortunately it lacks <b>basic facts</b> on the Apostles, which is something this site provides to its users!</p>
